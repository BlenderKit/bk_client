## About

This repository contains the **BlenderKit-Client** (formerly *daemon*) — a small
local HTTP server written in Go. It runs on the user's machine and bridges the
BlenderKit DCC add-ons with the [BlenderKit service](https://www.blenderkit.com/):
it handles search, downloads, uploads, login/OAuth2, ratings, comments and more,
and reports progress back to the connected software.

It is designed to be used in two ways:

- **As a subrepository** embedded into the BlenderKit add-ons:
  - [`blenderkit_addon`](https://github.com/BlenderKit/blenderkit) (Blender)
  - `bk_maya` (Maya)
  - `blenderkit_rhino` (Rhino)
- **As a standalone app** with its own settings and a small set of features.

The Client is built for Windows, macOS and Linux on both x86_64 and arm64. Multiple
Client versions can coexist on a single machine, and several can run at the same
time (each on its own port), so different DCCs/add-on versions are supported
side by side.

## Repository layout

```
client/                 Go source for the BlenderKit-Client
  *.go                  HTTP handlers, networking, login, download, wrappers…

  VERSION               Current Client version
dev.py                  Developer helper (build / run / verify / test / lint / docs)
pyproject.toml          Python tooling config (ruff, pydoclint) for tools/
```

## Developer quick start

Requirements: a recent **Go** toolchain (see [`client/go.mod`](client/go.mod)) and
**Python 3.10+** with the dev tools (`ruff`, `pydoclint`) for linting the recipes.

All commands go through [`dev.py`](dev.py):

```sh
python dev.py build            # cross-compile the Client for all platforms -> ./out/vX.Y.Z/
python dev.py test             # run Go unit tests + lint the Python recipes
python dev.py lint             # ruff + pydoclint on client/tools (no changes)
python dev.py format           # ruff format + auto-fix on client/tools
python dev.py docs             # regenerate the API documentation
python dev.py verify <path>    # verify code-signing/notarization of built binaries
```

You can also work directly in the `client/` directory with the Go toolchain:

```sh
cd client
go test ./...                  # run all Go tests (incl. the API drift test)
go generate ./...              # regenerate docs/openapi.json and docs/API.md
go build .                     # build a Client for the current platform
```

## API

The Client exposes a local HTTP API (default port **62485**). It is documented from
a single source of truth and published in two formats:

- [`client/docs/openapi.json`](client/docs/openapi.json) — OpenAPI 3.1 (Postman/Insomnia, Swagger UI/Redoc, SDK generation).
- [`client/docs/API.md`](client/docs/API.md) — human-readable reference.

See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for how the Client is started and how the
docs stay in sync with the code.

## Roadmap

Planned work for this repository (tracked incrementally):

- **Local Client configuration** stored next to the binary (`blenderkit-client-config.json`),
  excluding the API key, which must be stored with maximum available security.
  Foundation in [`client/internal/config`](client/internal/config/config.go); wiring it
  into Client startup and a settings UI is next.
- Settings change notifications pushed to connected DCCs.
- A taskbar/menubar tray icon to open settings, view logs, etc. *(Windows
  implemented: shown automatically for standalone runs; macOS/Linux pending —
  they need a cgo build.)*
- Automated, signed builds on Git, consumable live by developers or as packaged
  binaries by end users.
